Montesinos 2021-02-25 1 Introduction By 2040, infrastructure investment needs are projected to reach trillions just to keep pace with GDP growth. These estimates are beyond what traditional public sources of funding can afford. Just in US, the infrastructure gap is estimated at USD 1.4 trillion even if states and cities were to invest USD 1.8 trillion between 2016 and 2025 (ASCE). Governments across the globe have turned to public-private partnerships (PPPs) and other innovative infrastructure delivery formats as a complementary model to address the infrastructure gap challenge. With traditional sources of public sector funding dwindling, governments more than ever are turning to alternative sources of financing and innovative infrastructure delivery models models, such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to meet these infrastructure investment goals. But which of the many candidate projects should be undertaken? What is the right distribution of risks in a contract? How will this affect government final costs? The ability to answer these questions, depends on the evaluation of these projects based on robust financial principles that measure correctly the cost of risks and flows involved. This will help decision-makers avoid common miscalculations deriving, for instance, from government accounting conventions or valuation approaches that often misrepresent the financial costs of projects and their associated contractual claims. 1.1 Goals GCFP Infrastructure Finance initiative seeks to provide the financial techniques to help leaders in the public and private sectors to: 1.
